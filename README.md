# Tray Example

App used for Mac OS X as a tray app with a popover
using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

The app shows a couple of presaved command lines - that may be useful for developers.

Built with [photon](http://photonkit.com).

git clone https://github.com/yomart/tray-command-line
cd tray-command-line
npm install
npm start
```
